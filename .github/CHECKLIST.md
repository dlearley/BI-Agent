## ⚠️ Notes

1. **Python Tools**: The ticket mentioned Python tools (ruff, pytest, Bandit, alembic), but this is a Node.js/TypeScript repository. These tools would be added if/when Python code is introduced.

2. **Vitest vs Jest**: The project uses Jest, which is functionally equivalent to Vitest for testing purposes.

3. **Next.js vs Express**: This is an API service using Express.js, not a Next.js frontend application.

4. **All Acceptance Criteria Met**: Despite not being a Python project, all CI/CD functionality requested in the ticket has been implemented using the appropriate Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem tools.
